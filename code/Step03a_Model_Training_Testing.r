# MAGIC The 3-1-1 data in these 3 cities are organized in parquet format.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Apache Parquet is a free and open-source column-oriented data storage format of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. It is similar to the other columnar-storage file formats available in Hadoop namely RCFile and ORC. It is compatible with most of the data processing frameworks in the Hadoop environment. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk.

# MAGIC A forecast is the mean or median of simulated futures of a time series.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The very simplest forecasting method is to use the most recent observation; this is called a naive forecast and can be implemented in a namesake function. This is the best that can be done for many time series including most stock price data, and even if it is not a good forecasting method, it provides a useful benchmark for other forecasting methods.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For seasonal data, a related idea is to use the corresponding season from the last year of data. For example, if you want to forecast the sales volume for next March, you would use the sales volume from the previous March. This is implemented in the snaive() function, meaning, seasonal naive.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For both forecasting methods, you can set the second argument h, which specifies the number of values you want to forecast; as shown in the code below, they have different default values. The resulting output is an object of class forecast. This is the core class of objects in the forecast package, and there are many functions for dealing with them including summary() and autoplot().
